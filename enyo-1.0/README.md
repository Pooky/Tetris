Enyo 1.0 JavaScript Application Framework
-----------------------------------------

This is Enyo 1.0, the original version of the JavaScript application framework
that was distributed in HP webOS 2.2 and 3.0.  This code has only been tested
throughly in the webOS runtime environment, although it has been used
extensively in desktop versions of Google Chrome and Apple Safari.

This version, tagged as "r1", corresponds with Enyo 1.0 submission 128 that
shipped on HP webOS 3.0.5 in January 2012.

No further development is planned on the 1.0 tree.

The code is released under the Apache 2.0 license.  See
[LICENSE-2.0.txt](LICENSE-2.0.txt) for the full text of the license.
